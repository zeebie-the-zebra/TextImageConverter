# TextImageConverter
Based off the work of Patrik Roos from Text-Image.com,visit Patrik at https://github.com/darkgray1981

What does it do?
Patriks Image to HTML opperated single image at a time. upon speaking to Patrik they had a version that did batch runs.
However I was unable to get the application to work on windows 11.
Based off his work in Pike, I have written this clone in VB.net

How to use.
Stick your Images that need to be processed into HTML into the images folder.
Modify the varablies in the configuration.ini to your liking (The ini file is directly taken from Patriks work)
Then run the TextImageConverter.exe
It will output all the images into HTML into the HTML folder

Why did I write this in VB.net and not something like phyton? I like vb.net.
